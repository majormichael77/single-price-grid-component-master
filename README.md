### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6370690/media-queries-how-to-target-desktop-tablet-and-mobile) - This helped me for the device sizes in order to be able to achieve the mobile responsive view. 
- [resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10835500/how-to-change-text-transparency-in-html-css) - This is an amazing read as i had difficulty toning the look of some font cripsness it helped helped me understanding opacity in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
